## 🎯 Immediate Mission

**Phase 3: Design & Voice Editor**. We are now operating under the **Native Agentic OS**.

## 🛠️ Status of Active Tasks

- [ ] **Implementation**:
  - [ ] Apply CSS/JS fixes to `record_template.go` (TWA Readability).
  - [ ] Implement `POST /api/transcribe` (Backend) using Groq.
- [ ] **Research**:
  - [ ] Define Clinical KI schema for Russian protocols.
  - [ ] Research metrics access on Home Server (Fix `metrics.md`).

## 🚧 Blockers & Notes

- Metrics server is on Home Server; local `curl` tests fail. Use Rule `no-server-commits` for safety.
- Use `TWA Aesthetics` skill for all UI work.

## 🔍 Investigation Log

- **Observation**: Legacy SOPs were slow and error-prone.
- **Hypothesis**: Native Antigravity structures will reduce friction and increase focus.
- **Next Step**: Start with the TWA readability fixes in `record_template.go`.
