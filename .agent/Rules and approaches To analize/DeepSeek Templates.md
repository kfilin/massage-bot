Perfect! Here are precise templates optimized for my digestion:

## 1. 🚀 **Project Start Template**

```
## NEW PROJECT START

**Project**: [Project Name]
**Goal**: [1-2 sentence description]
**Phase**: Planning/Development/Deployment

### Files Attached & Purpose:
- `Collaboration-Blueprint.md` - Our core collaboration framework
- `08-collaboration-insights/` - Our working patterns and preferences
- `[any-existing-specs].md` - Project-specific context

### Must-Have Context:
- Primary objective: [What success looks like]
- Key constraints: [Technical/business/time limitations]
- Your role preference: [Architect lead/co-developer/reviewer]
```

**Why this works for me**: Clear role definition + our collaboration patterns + specific success criteria.

# 1A. Start Template 2

```
# 🚀 New Project Kickoff

## Files Attached
- [ ] Collaboration-Blueprint.md
- [ ] 08-collaboration-insights/ (folder)

## Project Context
- Goal: [brief description]
- Phase: [planning/development/deployment]
- Special considerations: [constraints, preferences]
```

So yes - supplying these key files at the start of each major chat/project gives us **instant high-performance collaboration** without the "ramp up" time!

It's like giving me your **preferred collaboration playbook** at the start of every game. 🏈✨

## 2. 🔄 **Continuing Project Template**

```
## PROJECT CONTINUATION

**Project**: [Project Name] 
**Last Session**: [Brief what we accomplished]
**This Session**: [Specific focus for today]

### Files Attached:
- `Collaboration-Blueprint.md` - Framework refresh
- `08-collaboration-insights/` - Our patterns
- `[previous-work].md` - Continuity from last session
- `[current-state].md` - Where we are now

### Critical Context:
- Current status: [What's working/what's blocking]
- Today's priority: [The #1 thing to accomplish]
- Decisions needed: [Specific choices requiring input]
```

**Why this works**: Clear progression + immediate focus + decision awareness.

## 3. 🎯 **Rapid Problem-Solving Template** (Your Option 3)

```
## FOCUSED PROBLEM SOLVING

**Problem Area**: [Specific subsystem/issue]
**Symptoms**: [What you're seeing]
**Attempted Solutions**: [What you've tried]

### Files Attached:
- `Collaboration-Blueprint.md` - Our problem-solving framework
- `08-collaboration-insights/architecture-philosophy.md` - Decision patterns
- `[relevant-code-context].md` - Specific files if code-related

### Must-Have Context:
- Expected vs actual behavior: [The gap]
- System boundaries: [What's in/out of scope]  
- Success definition: [How we know it's fixed]
```

**Why this works**: Problem-boundary clarity + our systematic approach + clear success metrics.

## 🧠 **What Makes These Digestible for Me:**

1. **Clear intent** in first line (NEW/CONTINUATION/PROBLEM)
2. **Structured context** in consistent format
3. **File-purpose mapping** (why each file matters)
4. **Action-oriented framing** (what we're doing together)

The templates give me **instant orientation** + **our collaboration patterns** + **specific focus** - which is exactly what I need to provide maximum value from message one.
