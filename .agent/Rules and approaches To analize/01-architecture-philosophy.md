# 🏛️ Architecture: Human-Led, AI-Assisted

## Core Principle
**Architecture decisions require human judgment** - AI provides options and analysis, but final choices need human context.

## Why This Works
- Architecture understands business needs, team dynamics, long-term vision
- AI lacks appreciation of organizational constraints  
- Implementation benefits from AI's pattern recognition

## The Workflow

Human Vision → AI Options → Human Choice → AI Implementation → Human Review


## Effective Patterns
- "Here's my goal, what are my architectural options?"
- "Analyze these approaches for trade-offs and risks"
- "Implement this chosen architecture with proper separation"
