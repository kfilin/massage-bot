# 📖 Agentic OS User Manual

Welcome to your new Agent-driven project. This "Operating System" uses native Antigravity features to automate rituals and ensure engineering quality.

## 🛠️ 1. Setup & Tailoring

1. **Define the OS**: Edit `.agent/Collaboration-Blueprint.md` to set your project's technology and role definitions.
2. **Initialize the Hub**: Set your project version and goals in `.agent/Project-Hub.md`.
3. **Expert Skills**: Populate `.agent/skills/[EXPERT_NAME]/SKILL.md` for specific domains like "Deployment" or "Database".

## 🤖 2. Working with the Agent

### Command & Control

- **/checkpoint**: Use this to end a session. It handles Git, Changelogs, and Handoffs.
- **/report**: Customize this workflow in `.agent/workflows/report.md` to trigger your project's health checks.

### The Reasoning Loop

I follow two strict **Rules** located in `.agent/rules/`:

- **Logic Over Compliance**: I will push back if I see technical debt.
- **Hypothesis First**: I will explain my plan before touching code.

## 🔄 3. Lifecycle Files

- **`Project-Hub.md`**: The current source of truth. Read this at start-of-session.
- **`handoff.md`**: The bridge between sessions.
- **`walkthrough.md`**: Generated by me to show you proof of UI/Logic changes.

## 📈 4. Growth

As you add complexity, create new **Skills** in `.agent/skills/`. This allows me to "equip" different expertise only when it is actually needed, keeping my performance fast and accurate.
